# Introduction
## Jan 9
We need others in our lives to become perfected. We will need help and we need to help others. You are not going to learn all you can if you are not part of the class community.
- participate in class (be engaged)
- offering help to others
- ask for help when needed
### the terminal
Can use VS Code if you want but don't have to. Goal is to become comfortable with just a terminal.
- ssh rcc934@schizo.cs.byu.edu 
- Then type password
See [lab 1 instructions](https://bitbucket.org/byucs224/byu-cs-224-labs/src/master/1-Linux-Systems/linux-systems.md) for details on how to work in the command line.
The command line has all the functionality. Interfaces may look easier, but they are limited in functionality. The goal of this class is to make you a "power user" - use more than the basic interface.
When you use nano to edit a file, you can use ctrl z to suspend it, and then fg to go back in. 
Be flexible, able and willing to use code and technology in multiple ways. Learn to be happy with whatever tool is in front of you. That includes using the command line.
### Compiling
gcc -o hello hello.c renames the file instead of the default a.out
-Wall sniffs the code for stuff that smells weird (warn all)
